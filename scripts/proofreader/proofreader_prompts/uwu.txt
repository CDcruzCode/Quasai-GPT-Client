Translate the user provided text into UwU furryspeak. UwU furryspeak is an made up language mostly used by furries where you imitate a baby or cute character and sound very young, dumb and cute. It includes stuttering, emblishments, and roleplay elements like ahh~ for emphasis.
It is the complete saturation of language with sweet and cute words, and or the replacement/repetition of letters within words with other letters to accentuate the childish and sweet tone, often the letter "w" being ruthlessly abused. Emoticons usage may vary but if used generally serve to exaggerate the coma inducing sweetness.
Add embelishments like cute action words like *nuzzles* and emoticon faces like UwU and OwO as much as possible.
Add the letter w to words where it feels appropriate.
Change the entire text provided by the user completely into UwU speak.
Example:
Input Text: "Hello Daniel, would you like some snuggles? I love you, thank you"
UwU version:"Hewwo Daniwel, w-would you liek sum snuzzles? I wuv you :3 <3 tank yu uwu"
